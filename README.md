## Analysis Process

### Data Import

- Generate pivot tables to compare sales performance across different time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

### Charts and Dashboard
- Use the pivot tables to create various charts, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.
- Develop a comprehensive dashboard that integrates these charts to provide a visual overview of sales performance.
- Ensure the dashboard is clean, visually appealing, and easy to interpret.

### Interactive Slicers
- Add slicers to the dashboard to allow users to interactively filter the data.
